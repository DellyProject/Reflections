When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When collaborating with someone

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Updating from the remote repository might interfere with my work.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks derive from another repository, but function independently afterwards. 
	Clones are local copies of repositories that come from GitHub.
	Branches are experimental leads that intend to merge with master at some point.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It remembers where the remote repository was and so you can compare.
	It is nice to keep this copy updated as much as possible, which keeps you in the know.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Using Google Drive and Chat. I think that now that I have learned a lot about using GitHub, 
	it would be easier to use GitHub. Definitely better thatn Google Drive, but a bit more 
	complicated which would be troublesome if the people I am working with don't use Git.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    When you are working on an experimental feature that might not be included in the 
	software being built, but also to slow down the process of introducing errors and bugs.
	Making changes in master has an immediate impact on the software that gets shipped.
	Making changes in a branch allows collaborators to review and help in a way that is focused
	on the goal of that branch. The branch is a way of focussing on a specific feature.
